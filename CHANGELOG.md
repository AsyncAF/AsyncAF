# [3.0.0-prerelease.1](https://github.com/AsyncAF/AsyncAF/compare/v2.0.0...v3.0.0-prerelease.1) (2018-05-01)


### Bug Fixes

* **logAF:** fix bug where incorrect filename would log when using minified files ([351b696](https://github.com/AsyncAF/AsyncAF/commit/351b696))
* set --add (-a) flag so gh-pages doesn't delete .circleci for docs PRs ([5e89316](https://github.com/AsyncAF/AsyncAF/commit/5e89316))
* use [filebase] instead of [file] in banner so parent dir doesn't show up after refactor ([931c1b2](https://github.com/AsyncAF/AsyncAF/commit/931c1b2))


### Features

* revert to previous way of preserving function arity w/ rest params instead of arguments obj ([d75dd8f](https://github.com/AsyncAF/AsyncAF/commit/d75dd8f))
